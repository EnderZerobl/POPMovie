# Creators

<p>This work was developed by me and my colleague <a href="https://github.com/Prianjss" style="text-decoration: none">Priscila Anjos</a>. In this work, I did the Backend part and she did the Frontend part.</p>

# Tecnologies 

<p>We use in the backend, the express and prisma technologies, having SQlite as a database, in this fragment of the work. On the frontend, Nextjs, a React framework, was used. As for the main language, Typescript was used both in the Frontend and in the Backend.</p>
<p>It is worth considering that we use axios, which is a promise-based HTTP Client, for the integration between the parts of the work</p>

<p>On the movie's website, it is possible to register and log in to accounts. In addition, the home page has the Api releases of the IMDB platform, containing information about the movies, futhermore to the possibility of searching for them. There is also the possibility to bookmark the movies by saving them on the favorites page. Finally, there is the "My Movies" page that displays the description of the movies</p>
<p style="font-style:italic">The website also has responsive versions for use on different screens</p>

# How to use

<p>First, in your preferred IDE, you need to navigate to the "Backend" folder and search for the "Package.Json" file and then install the dependencies and dev-dependencies present there. Repeat the same process on the Frontend.</p>
<p>To open the project in your browser, you need to navigate to the two folders (Backend and Frontend) in different terminals and run them at the same time</p>

```
If you use Vscode, just do it

First terminal =

cd Backend
npm install
npm run dev

Second terminal =

cd Frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
